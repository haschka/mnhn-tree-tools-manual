\section{simulation\_verification}

\subsection{General}

This is a small tool that tells you how many families created by a virtual
evolution run performed using the tools shown in section
\ref{sec-virtual-ev} can be found by an adaptive clustering run executed using
the tools shown in section \ref{sec-adaptive-clust}. As such this is
an internal quality measurement tool.

\subsection{Usage}

The tool can be run by issuing the following command:

\lstset{language=bash,
  caption={Calling the \emph{simulation\_verification} tool},
  label=lst-simver-call}
\begin{lstlisting}
simulation_verification [fasta] [partitions] [precision] [split-sets]
\end{lstlisting}
with the arguments:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{fasta} A FASTA file containing a virtual evolution
    dataset as generated with the tools in section
    \ref{sec-virtual-ev}.
  \item \emph{partitions} The number of partitions in the dataset as
    chosen during the virtual evolution run.
  \item \emph{precision} How many sequences have to attributed
    correctly to a family or cluster in order to be proven to be
    correct. If you chose for instance 0.8 here a family of 1000
    sequences can only be found in clusters that have between 800 and
    1200 sequences and hold at least 800 sequences of the of the
    original partition. 
  \item \emph{split-sets} The binary clusters layer files that are the
    result of an adaptive clustering run performed with the tools presented in
    section \ref{sec-adaptive-clust}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Example}
\lstset{language=bash,
  caption={An example of the \emph{simulation\_verification} tool.},
  label=lst-simver-example}
\begin{lstlisting}
simulation_verification sim.fasta 10 0.8 /tmp/s*
\end{lstlisting}
In this example the simulation verification tool uses the simulated dataset
sim.fasta which contains 10 partitions and investigates if clusters found
during an adaptive clustering run yielded at least in one layer the correct
attribution of a family under the precision criteria 0.8.

A possible output might be:
\lstset{language={},
  caption={Example output of the \emph{simulation\_verification}
    tool.},
  label=lst-simver-output-example}
\begin{lstlisting}
Found 8 out of 10 partitions
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Implementation}
The tool is implemented in \emph{simulation\_verification.c}.
