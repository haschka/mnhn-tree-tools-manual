\section{virtual\_evolution} \label{sec-virtual-ev}

The tools \emph{virtual\_evolution} and
\emph{virtual\_evolution\_controlled} allow you to simulate simple
evolutionary processes and generate nucleic sequences ressembling to
these evolutionary processes. Your simulated biosphere will then
reside in a FASTA file.

\subsection{Usage}

The evolution simulating in MNHN-Tree-Tools comes in two versions in
rougher \emph{virtual\_evolution} tool and in a more controlled, later
added \emph{virtual\_evolution\_controlled} tool.

The tools can be called like:

The \emph{tree\_map\_for\_sequence} tool can be used:
\lstset{language=bash,
  caption={Calling the \emph{virtual\_evolution} tools},
  label=lst-virtev-call}
\begin{lstlisting}
virtual_evolution [seed] [seq-length] [n-sequences] [n-partitions] \
  [max-time] [rate] [n-mutations-to-amplification-template] [fasta]
virtual_evolution_controlled [seed] [seq-length] [n-sequences] [n-partitions] \
  [max-time] [rate] [n-mutations-to-previous-amplification-template] [fasta]
\end{lstlisting}
with the following parameters:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{seed} The seed, to pseudorandom number generators used,
    that permits you to generate the same set of sequences
    in subsequent calls of this tool.
  \item \emph{seq-length} The length of the sequences to be generated.
  \item \emph{n-sequences} How many sequences in total have to be
    generated.
  \item \emph{n-partitions} How many families/clusters shall be
    generated, i.e. how many amplification events should happen.
  \item \emph{max-time} If the evolution should accur at random times
    beteween amplifications and be limited to \emph{max-time}. -1 here
    chooses a constant evolution cycle, befor a new cluster expansion
    happens, otherwise a random number of evolution cycles may occur,
    between 0 and \emph{max-time}.
  \item \emph{rate} substitution of bases in the nucleic sequence per
    evolution cycle.
  \item \emph{n-mutations-to-amplication-template} Adds the here
    chosen number of mutation to the amplification template before
    cluster expansion. In this case the nucleotide bases are only $X$
    times as chosen here replaced. This actual number of mutations
    might be lower as the replaced base might be the same as the
    nucleotide that was already in place.
  \item \emph{n-mutations-to-previous-amplification-template} Adds
    this number of real mutations to the previous amplification
    template, before generating a new family.
  \item \emph{fasta} A FASTA file where to output the sequences in
    question.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{algorithm}
The algorithms between the two simulation process are different as
such we begin to present the,
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{virtual\_evolution} process. The evolutionary process
    herein is a basic expansion and diffusion process. The way this
    simulator works is that it generates a template sequence of a
    given size. It then copy this sequence until it fills a whole
    family as defined by the \emph{n-sequences} and
    \emph{n-partitions} arguments. A family or partition as such
    contains
    \begin{equation}
      N = n_{\mathrm{seq}}/n_{\mathrm{part}},
    \end{equation} sequences where
    $n_{\mathrm{seq}}$ are the number of total sequences and
    $n_{\mathrm{part}}$ are the number of partitions or families to be
    created. It than performs
    \begin{equation}
      M = ptr \label{eqn-mutation-rate}
    \end{equation}
    mutations on the previous partitions generated. Where $t$ is a random
    time, and hence number of cycles number, which is chosen between 0
    and $t_{\mathrm{max}}$ which is defined by the \emph{max-time}
    parameter. $r$ is the mutation rate as defined by the \emph{rate}
    parameter. $p$ is the number of partitions already generated.
    Once $M$ mutation were perfomed on the current state of the
    dataset. A sequence is randomly chosen from the previous
    sequencies and will be the template for the next expension of $N$
    sequences. The algorithm is continued until all partitions are
    created, perfoming a last mutation run on the entire dataset as
    determined by equation \ref{eqn-mutation-rate}.
    The whole process is further outlined in figure
    \ref{fig-virtual-evolution}.
  \item \emph{virtual\_evolution\_controlled} is a different, simpler
    but more controlable process. The main difference to the
    uncontrolled \emph{virtual\_evolution\_process} is that the
    template for each family is chosen from the previous template to
    create a partition or family, and not randomly chosen from the
    existing sequences. Further the number of mutations is enforced
    not be just exchanges of nucleotides that might actually not lead
    to mutations but to actual mutations. Hence you perfectly know how
    far the templates between different families are away, and with a
    fixed rate of mutations can perfectly estimate the diffusion of
    each partition. Hence we have a perfectly controlled
    distance-diffusion mechanism. The process is outlined in figure
    \ref{fig-virtual-evolution-controlled}.

    show how diffused, (old) the sequences are at the end of the
    process. Please note that $t$ is chosen at random after each
    partition expension.}

  \caption{The more restricted controlled virtual evolution
    process. The different level of gray show how diffused, (old) the
    sequences are at the end of the process. Again note there are
    $M = ptr$ mutations happening across the available sequences after
    each expansion and that $t$ might be variable if chosen so.}

\subsection{example}
\lstset{language=bash,
  caption={Example of using the \emph{virtual\_evolution} tools},
  label=lst-virtev-example}
\begin{lstlisting}
virtual_evolution_controlled 42 100 10000 10 -1 1000 4 biosphere.fasta
\end{lstlisting}
Here the evolutionary process generates 10000 sequences of 100
nucleotides, in 10 partitions of 1000 sequences and a mutation rate
$r=1000$. The time $t=1$, or number of cycles is fixed to one though
that the diffusion stays constant during the process. The template
undergoes 4 mutations before creating each new family. The resulting
sequences are stored to \emph{biosphere.fasta}.

\subsection{implementation}
\emph{virtual\_evolution} and \emph{virtual\_evolution\_controlled}
are implemented in \emph{virtual\_evolution.c} and
\emph{virtual\_evolution\_controlled.c} respectivly.
