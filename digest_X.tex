\section{digest\_X}

The \emph{digest\_X} tools allow you to virtually digest a sequence
using restriction enzymes creating a FASTA file with the sequences
cutted appart. Currently following tools corresponding to the following
restrinction enzymes are implemented: \emph{digest\_XbaI}, \emph{digest\_XmnI}
and \emph{digest\_HindIII}. 

\subsection{Usage}
The tools can be used in the following manner:
\lstset{language=bash,
  caption={Calling the \emph{digest\_X} tools},
  label=lst-digest-call}
\begin{lstlisting}
digest_XbaiI [fasta] [n-threads] > [fasta-out]
digest_XmnI [fasta] [n-threads] > [fasta-out]
digest_HindIII [fasta] [n-threads] > [fasta-out]
\end{lstlisting}
with the arguments:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{fasta} A FASTA file. Only the first sequence of the \emph{fasta}
  file will be digested.
\item \emph{n-threads} How many threads to use for this digestion process.
\item \emph{fasta-out} A fasta file containing the digested sequences.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Example}
\lstset{language=bash,
  caption={Example of the \emph{digest\_X} tools},
  label=lst-digest-example}
\begin{lstlisting}
digest_HindIII test.fasta 8 > digested.fasta
\end{lstlisting}
Digests the first sequence stored in \emph{test.fasta} and stores the resulting
sequences in \emph{digested.fasta}. The digestion process can use up to eight
threads on the machine it runs on. The restriction enzyme used for this
virtual digestion is HindIII. 

\subsection{Implementation}
The interface to the \emph{digest\_X} tools is implemented in \emph{digester.c}
The digestion engine is implemented in \emph{restriction\_digest.c}.
