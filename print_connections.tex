\section{print\_connections}
The \emph{print\_connections} tool allows you to highlight
connections, just as printed in the output file of an adaptive
clustering run. This means it shows which cluster of a more dense
stage of an adaptive clustering run is embedded into a cluster of less
dense stage of an adaptive clustering run. A connection is formed if
80\% of the sequences of a cluster of a higher density is found in a
cluster with a lower density. 

\subsection{Usage}
\lstset{language=bash,
  caption={Calling the \emph{print\_connections} tool},
  label=lst-printconnections-call}
\begin{lstlisting}
print_connections [lower-layer-split-set] [upper-layer-split-set]
\end{lstlisting}
where \emph{lower-layer-split-set} and \emph{upper-layer-split-set}
are binary clusterings obtained from an adaptive clustering run that
was perfomed with the tools highlighted in section \ref{sec-adaptive-clust}. The
\emph{upper-layer-split-set} should be a clustering with a higher
density then the \emph{lower-layer-split-set}.
