\section{print\_connections}

The \emph{print\_connections} tool allows you to highlight
connections in the same way as they are listed in the output file of an adaptive
clustering run. This means it highlights which cluster of a layer with
a higher sequence density limit obtained from  an adaptive clustering
run is embedded into a cluster of a layer with a lower squence density
limit. A connection is formed if 80\% of the sequences of a cluster of
a higher density is found in a cluster with a lower density limit. 

\subsection{Usage}

The tool can be called issuing the folling command:
\lstset{language=bash,
  caption={Calling the \emph{print\_connections} tool},
  label=lst-printconnections-call}
\begin{lstlisting}
print_connections [lower-layer-split-set] [upper-layer-split-set]
\end{lstlisting}
where \emph{lower-layer-split-set} and \emph{upper-layer-split-set}
are binary clusterings obtained from an adaptive clustering run that
was performed with the tools outlined in section \ref{sec-adaptive-clust}. The
\emph{upper-layer-split-set} should be a clustering with a higher
density then the \emph{lower-layer-split-set}.
